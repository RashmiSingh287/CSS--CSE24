    <div id="box1"> <i>Nature is beautiful, yet it is difficult to put into words. Nature is honoured with a variety of religious traditions. The primary source of life on Earth is the components that exist naturally. All of the elements are linked. Natural ingredients can never be substituted. Humans process natural materials for use in today’s ever-changing world and destroy their rawness and individuality. Human activities have an impact on nature, and as a result, the quality of the environment is deteriorating. Deterioration of nature is primarily caused by pollution of the air and water. The oxygen produced by a single fully-grown tree is enough to supply ten people, and the amount of oxygen released by a forest is unquestionably adequate for a metropolis or town. Nature is a healer, and it is the foundation for many industries. Nature, on the other hand, is both a giver and a taker, according to legends. Earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, floods, and cyclones are examples of natural calamities. These disasters, which occur as a result of natural causes, have resulted in significant damage. The benefits of sunlight and fresh air to our health cannot be overstated. Nature has a variety of beneficial effects on our bodies. For recuperation and vacations, people choose natural settings. People prefer to raise their children in the countryside in the United States. Their primary goal is to introduce their children to the benefits of natural beauty.</i>
With the increasing population, the threats towards nature are increasing. With the growth in population, the resources are now depleting. Excessive levels of air and environmental pollutants add to the mix. Industrial waste, unrestricted vehicle use, illicit tree cutting, wildlife hunting, nuclear power plants, and a slew of other factors are contributing to the disruption of natural systems. The extinction of species as enormous as dinosaurs and the survival of animals as tiny as ants have been documented in history. It is unavoidable to remember, among other things, that nature can play both a protective and destructive role. Natural disasters, pandemics, and natural crisis scenarios have demonstrated the need for humans to maintain the subtle balance of nature in order to ensure the continuation of life on Earth for the benefit of future generations.

    <div id="box2"> Animals are integral components of our planet’s ecosystem, contributing to its balance and diversity. Firstly, biodiversity relies heavily on the presence of various animal species. Each species occupies a specific ecological niche, regulating populations of other organisms and maintaining the health of ecosystems. For instance, predators help control prey populations, preventing overgrazing or overpopulation of certain species. Additionally, animals play crucial roles in nutrient cycling and seed dispersal, further enhancing ecosystem stability.</div>
   Secondly, animals provide numerous benefits to humans. They serve as sources of food, clothing, and medicine. Domesticated animals like cows and chickens are primary sources of meat and eggs, while sheep provide wool for textiles. Furthermore, animals contribute to scientific research, enabling advancements in medicine and technology. Studying animal behavior and physiology helps researchers develop treatments for human diseases and understand complex biological processes.

Lastly, animals hold significant cultural and emotional value for humans. Many species inspire art, literature, and spiritual beliefs. Moreover, pets offer companionship and emotional support to millions of people worldwide. Conservation efforts aimed at protecting endangered species not only preserve biodiversity but also safeguard cultural heritage and emotional connections to the natural world. In summary, the importance of animals transcends ecological, economic, and emotional realms, emphasizing the need for their conservation and responsible stewardship. 
 <hr><div id="box3"> <h2>Importance of Animals in Environment and Ecosystem </h2>
The cycle of predating and becoming the prey is what keeps the ecosystem in order. Carnivores, such as hyenas and wolves, prey on herbivores, such as goats.

The herbivores feed on grass and plants. In turn, these animals produce carbon dioxide, which the plants use for their growth and production of oxygen.

When these animals die, their bodies decompose into the soil (by microorganisms) and provide nutrients for the plants. In this way, the animals keep the cycle stable.

Bees collect nectar from flowers, and during this process, they also collect the sticky pollen grains on the flowers. When they sit on another flower to collect some more nectar, the pollen grains detach and collect on the flower. In this way, pollination takes place, and new plants grow. They then produce the essential gas, the source of all life—oxygen.

When this equilibrium is disturbed, usually by human interference, things begin to spiral downwards.

If the predators are killed, the number of herbivores will increase rapidly. This will decrease the amount of plant life and grass in that region, and naturally, the herbivores will come out of their habitat.

Animals like elephants (herbivores) can destroy one whole season’s worth of crops if disturbed in such a manner. That’s why it is essential that animals must not be harmed. Animals are a vital part of the ecosystem.

Another environmental importance of animals is that they take care of other animals. A good example is an elephant.

Elephants use their trunks—which have almost 40,000 muscles—to dig up watering holes. A wate</div>

    <div id="box4"> What about the value of the world’s natural ecosystem services? A first estimate was put at an average $33 trillion annually – that’s 12 noughts or a million million.   

More to the point, this value of nature is nearly twice global GNP of $18 trillion. 

The figures will have changed since these first calculations but it underlines the obvious - that nature is both invaluable and priceless. Put another way, if we’re silly enough to let nature decline can we afford to put it back? Three guesses. 

That matters when one considers another big global study of the state of nature and its value. The UN Millennium Ecosystem Assessment found that approximately two-thirds of the world’s natural ecosystems are degraded or being used in irresponsible, unsustainable ways. “Every year we lose three to five trillion dollars’ worth of natural capital, roughly equivalent to the amount of money we lost in the financial crisis of 2008–2009”, the report said. Every year. </div>
